          policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
            Images from unknown, public registries can be
            of dubious quality and may not be scanned and secured, representing a high degree
            of risk. Requiring use of known, approved registries helps reduce threat exposure
            by ensuring image pulls only come from them. This policy validates that all
            images originate from a registry in the approved list.
