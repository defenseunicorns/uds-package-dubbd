# Defense Unicorns Big Bang Distro (DUBBD)

Pre-built Zarf Package of [DoD-Platform-One/big-bang](https://github.com/DoD-Platform-One/big-bang) configured for production use by Defense Unicorns.

## Prerequisites
- Zarf is installed. Current version used is: [v0.25.2](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/releases/tag/v0.25.2)
- Optional: A working Kubernetes cluster. e.g KinD, k3d, k3s, etc. If necessary, Zarf can be used to deploy a built-in k3s distribution.

## Build the package

```bash
$ cd defense-unicorns-distro
$ zarf package create --confirm
....
```

## Deploy the package

### Prereqs

Assumption is that there's a Kubernetes cluster that's already had `zarf init` run on it.

### Install Big Bang

2. Deploy the Big Bang package created in the Build step above:

```bash
zarf package deploy zarf-package-big-bang-amd64-*.tar.zst --confirm
```

Check whether the deployment succeeded. If the deployment is successful, then you should see this message from the HelmRelease resource in the cluster.

``` bash
$ kubectl get helmrelease -A

## Defense Unicorns Big Bang Distro for AWS (DUBBD-AWS)

:::warning
This Zarf package can only be built with the current head of https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf due to fixing [this issue](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/pull/1477)
:::


When running Big Bang on AWS, Loki is configured to use S3 for storage for better persistance.  The Zarf package for DUBBD-AWS is created by overlaying a new loki values file on top of the existing DUBBD zarf file via:

```yaml
  - name: bigbang
    required: true
    import:
      path: ../defense-unicorns-distro
    extensions:
      bigbang:
        version: "###ZARF_PKG_VAR_BIGBANG_VERSION###"
        valuesFiles:
        - values/aws-loki.yaml
```

In order for this configuration to work cleanly, DUBBD-AWS also provisions an S3 bucket from our [IaC Repo](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/iac/tree/main/modules/s3-irsa) that provides encryption at rest and a role to access the S3 bucket that gets used by Loki via [IRSA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html).
